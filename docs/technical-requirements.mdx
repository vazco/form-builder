# Technical requirements (versions)

## Prerequistences

Node.js

```shell
$ node --version
v14.20.0
```

npm

```shell
$ npm --version
6.14.17
```

Our current implementation requires Node.js and npm versions as listed above. Choosing them will help you to eliminate issues related to the installation of the package and its’ usage.

Our work is underway to provide the possibility to use newer versions of the runtime environment and package manager, stay tuned.

## Dependencies

FormBuilder is a tool that has a couple of external dependencies. All of them are listed below:

```
ajv@7.1.1
ajv-errors@2.0.0
ajv-formats@1.5.1
classnames@2.2.6
react@17.0.2
react-dnd@14.0.4
react-dnd-html5-backend@14.0.2
react-dnd-mouse-backend@1.0.0-rc.2
react-dnd-multi-backend@6.0.2
react-dnd-touch-backend@14.1.1
react-dom@17.0.2
react-popper@1.3.11
uniforms@3.4.0
uniforms-bridge-json-schema@3.4.0
```

The versions presented above are the recommended ones that we are sure will work for you. Although, all of them with minor updates  (`^` operator) should also do the trick.
It’s also important to note that the dependencies mentioned above are not “built-in” with FormBuilder and must be installed manually.
