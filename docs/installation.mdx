# Installation

The Forminer installation process is pretty straightforward and requires only a few steps.

## Unzip the Forminer package and add it to your project

The Forminer code will be delivered to you as a zip file. Unzip it and copy it into the project. We suggest creating a `packages` directory for locally installed NPM packages.

```shell
npm install ./packages/forminer
yarn add file:./packages/forminer
pnpm add ./packages/forminer
```

## Install required dependencies

You should install one of the selected [uniforms](https://uniforms.tools/) themes that match your needs.

```shell
npm install uniforms-???@3.10.2
```
