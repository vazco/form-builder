description: Check what technology stack is required to use the Form Builder

# Supported technologies

FormBuilder's primary requirement is to use [React](https://reactjs.org/). The components for that tool are written within this library and are built to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). You're good to go if your current application already uses TypeScript and Sass. If not, you may need to configure your bundler (e.g., [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), etc.) to handle such files. Another option is to transpile (translate) all of the code manually, before incorporating it into your project.

## Other libraries/frameworks

If you're using another frontend framework it's not all lost! In any major frontend framework like Angular, Vue, Svelte, Ember, and many more there is a possibility to [install React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react). After doing that next step would be to check React documentation on how to implement it correctly in your app - [Integrating with Other View Libraries](https://reactjs.org/docs/integrating-with-other-libraries.html#integrating-with-other-view-libraries).

One of real life examples: you can create a simple React-based app (e.g. with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)) that will be used by forms creators, and use an application built with Angular for your customers that uses React and render the proper forms within it.

## FAQ

:::info Can I use it on the project with Angular/Svelte/Vue?
Yes, as per the explanation above
:::

:::info What are the technological limitations of Form Builder - with what stack it will work? <br/> What are possible workarounds for other technologies? What is not possible at all?
If you are able to install and use React with your current project then it's possible to use Form Builder. Please also check the dependencies section of technical documentation.
