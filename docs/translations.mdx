description: How to translate the Forminer UI and forms itself

# Translations (i18n)

We can think about this topic from two sides, depending on the user's perspective:

1. **The Forminer interface**, facing the users who create forms.

2. **The form view**, for the users who are filling the forms built with Forminer.

As it also impacts the way how it's handled in the code, we'll split this document into two sections.

## Translating the Forminer interface

The Forminer UI (labels, titles, tooltips, etc.) is completely translatable with a centralized i18n system. At its core is the `Translations` type, defining all of the required strings (e.g., `StyleTooltip`) and formatters (e.g., `RemovePageConfirmation`). Once you have a complete `Translations` object, pass it to the `Forminer` component in the `translations` prop:

```tsx
import { translations, Translations } from 'forminer';

const newTranslations: Translations = {
  ...translations,
  RemovePageConfirmation(pageNumber) {
    return `Are you sure you want to remove entire Page ${pageNumber}? Your fields might be lost.`;
  },
  StyleTooltip:
    'Define CSS styles to be used in rendered container of the field.JSON format',
};
```

## Translating the forms

While there's no built-in way of doing that, you can treat the translatable values (labels, placeholders, etc.) as translation keys. For example: instead of using the first name field's label as "First name", use "labels.firstName". Then, you can use it in one of these two ways:

1. Translate them directly **in the components**. This requires you to provide custom field and widget components but also gives you the most flexibility.

2. Translate them **in the form definition**. As the form definition is simply a JSON object (as described in [Form definition](form-definition)), you can modify it freely before passing it down to the `Forminer` component. That means you could translate all of the values up front and render a translated form. This requires some additional code but is seamless from the Forminer perspective.

In both scenarios, as the labels are provided as-is, you can use any tool to actually translate them. To visualize this example better, here's a code sample translating the labels using an external library:

```diff
 <Form
   components={components}
   containers={containers}
-  definition={definition}
+  definition={translateModel(definition)}
   widgets={widgets}
   translations={translations}
 />
```

```tsx
import translate from 'some-i18n-library';

function translateModel(model: Model) {
  return {
    ...model,
    views: model.views.map(view => ({
      ...view,
      label: translate(view.label),
    })),
  };
}
```

Of course, you can translate other fields too, as well as provide the translations with more context, e.g., the field's name or used component.
