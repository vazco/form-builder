# What is Forminer?

Vazco Forminer is a powerful tool for building forms in React. It offers a drag-and-drop interface for building forms, with nested fields, and vertical and horizontal lists.
Thanks to the schema-first approach, it is great for building low-code/no-code solutions. It allows you to easily prepare React forms once and use them with various themes.

The package is easy to integrate. It is also simple to customize and modify the look by editing the CSS.
